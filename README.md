# ttcraft

# Description

This is a Minecraft™-inspired game designed to be played with a Tiptoi™ pen. It originally started as a treasure hunt through the city but is now also evolving into a board game-like setting. The game utilizes tttool and Velocity templates.

# TODO

- improve readme
- put variable names in proper namespaces (c_, v_, t_)
- randomize goal
- refactor random2 / reset and selecting current item
- add P(5ms) where needed for gen2 pen
